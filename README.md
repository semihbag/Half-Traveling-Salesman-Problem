# Half-Traveling-Salesman-Problem
The half traveling salesman problem is more difficult than the traveling salesman problem. Because we have to consider the cities that should be selected. In this project, I tried to build an algorithm to solve the half traveling salesman problem as quickly as I could.


* To run the code, it is sufficient to run the main class in the default package.     
* In the main class, at the beginning of the code, the files are specified between the 11th and 15th lines. It can be run by removing the comment line of the desired file.       
* The input.txt file has been created for a special input attempt. The data can be run by importing into this file.       
* Every time the program runs, it writes the output to the output.txt file.     
* Also, in order to test my code, I created an input generator where we can adjust the city density on the map as we want. To run this program, it will be sufficient to run the InputCreator  class in the inputCreator package. Outputs are written to the inputCreator.txt file.
